# Hopping Robot Simulation

This folder contains MATLAB scripts that simulate a SLIP-based hopping robot for studying hopping motion in a virtual environment.

## Overview
The simulation calculates the ODE functions for the robot's hopping motion and generates an `.avi` file. This file allows users to visually assess the robot's hopping performance.

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Simulink

## Usage
1. Run the MATLAB scripts.
2. The simulation will compute the ODE functions.
3. An `.avi` file will be created for visual inspection of the hopping performance.
